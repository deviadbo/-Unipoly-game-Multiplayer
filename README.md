# Unipoly
##### by Deviad Bokobza
------------


Unipoly is a multiplayer game based on the familiar monopoly game.
The game can also be played as two single players on the same client, or in multiplayer mode on two different clients.
The game board has islands that can be purchased, the construction option is given only if the entire city has been purchased.
There are islands of companies - like UniGreen and UniSpace, etc.
And of course, the familiar Prison Island and Start Island.
Each island has a floating cloud with updated details of the island,
And after making a purchase each island will be marked with the owner's icon.

#### Architecture
I wrote the game using the MVC architecture, thus achieving a total separation of layers, which makes the game scalable and gives me the ability to easily change and test each module.

#### Technologies 
The game is developed in an environment of Unity and C#.
For the multiplayer mode I used in AppWarp API.

Below you will find some photos from the game, and a link to a YouTube video I made to demonstrate the game flows.
